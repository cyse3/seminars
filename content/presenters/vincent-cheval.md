I am a member of the PROSECCO team at Inria Paris. My main area of research is automated verification of security protocols. I am currently mostly working on three verification tools: DeepSec, ProVerif and GSVerif. Additionally, I am interested in automating verification of privacy type properties related to RFID protocols, rooting protocols in ad-hoc network, electronic voting protocols, etc.
