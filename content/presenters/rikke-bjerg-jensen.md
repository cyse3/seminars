Rikke is a Senior Lecturer in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London. She is a social scientist (ethnographer) and her work explores information security needs, perspectives and practices among groups of people living and working at the margins of societies. It focuses on how technology, as it is shaped by social structures, relations and interactions, facilitates multiple (individual and collective) security experiences and understandings. Her work is grounded in research with and within distinct groups of people, including seafarers, refugees/migrants and protesters, and has been published at CHI, CSCW, USENIX Security and specialist social science venues. She/her, they/them.
