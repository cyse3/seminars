Sam Collins is a PhD research student studying at the University of Birmingham, UK with an interest in attacks and defences in the Man-At-The-End-Scenario found in anti-cheat systems. He also works in teaching reverse engineering and binary analysis via game hacking. As part of this, he developed an impossible to beat multiplayer video game for undergraduate students to hack as coursework. During his research, he has been banned from every competitive shooter title and will happily offer this as a service for anyone who plays too much Fortnite and would like to stop.
