Since September 2022 I am a full-time researcher at Inria Nancy Grand Est in the Pesto team. I joined this team two years ago as a post-doctoral researcher after a PhD thesis at Inria Rennes under the supervision of S. Delaune. I work on the design of cryptographic protocols and their formal analyses. This includes both theoretical contributions to overcome the limitations of existing models and verification tools, and concrete contribution when studying the security of real-world systems. For two years now, I made a focus on e-voting systems.
