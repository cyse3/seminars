Asynchronous consensus has been considered the most robust, yet the most system-friendly consensus in the open network. Unfortunately, previous protocols suffer from low efficiency thus essentially none has been widely deployed. In this talk, we will introduce our recent progress on how to make asynchronous permissioned consensus really fast, and finally, real.
