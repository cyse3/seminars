The EasyCrypt proof assistant offers—in a single tool—the ability to reason about cryptographic security at various scales from primitives to protocols. However, this flexibility comes at a huge cost in usability. This talk will discuss insights gained through the recent formalisation of primitives (SHA-3, XMSS), constructions (KMS, crypto_box) and protocols (distance-bounding, AKE) and explore plans for improvements to the tool that would enable its use on larger protocols, and for the creation of beginner-friendly tutorial material that would enable it to be used more broadly.
