A cybersecurity incident can cripple an organization, particularly because of the related risk of significant reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased, so too has the importance of understanding what effective corporate communications and public relations look like after an attack. Key questions that need immediate answers include: What messages should be communicated to customers? How should correspondence be released? Who should speak to the media and public? In this talk, Dr. Nurse presents recent research into a playbook to support companies in deciding how to answer these questions and more. This work is grounded in real-world case studies and academic insights and has been validated and refined through interviews with senior security and crisis response industry professionals.
