The next-generation networks introduced higher flexibility and dynamicity in networking systems, but at the same time, they led to new threats and challenges. The traditional approach of a manual configuration of Network Security Functions (NSFs) such as firewalls and VPN gateways is not feasible anymore since it is not adequate for the ever-changing nature of modern networks and it is prone to human errors. To overcome this problem, the native flexibility provided by virtualization could be exploited to automate network security management. However, achieving a high level of automation while providing formal assurance that security management operations (e.g., configuration and orchestration) fulfill some security properties is still a complex research challenge. This presentation describes some novel approaches that combine automation, formal verification, and optimization for network security management.
